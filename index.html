                    Go (often referred to as Golang) is a statically typed, compiled programming language 
                    designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is syntactically 
                    similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.

                    There are two major implementations:

                    Google's self-hosting compiler toolchain targeting multiple operating systems, mobile devices, and WebAssembly.
                    gccgo, a GCC frontend.
                    A third compiler, GopherJS, compiles Go to JavaScript for front-end web development.

                    <p class ="text">Fast results:	It works like an interpreted language because of the fast compilation. You'll not notice that 
                            it's compiling. You'll think that as if you're working in an interpreted language like Ruby.</p>
                    <p class = "text">Safe: Strongly and statically typed and garbage collected. Strongly typed means: You can't pass any type of 
                            data everywhere. You need to be explicit. Statically typed means: Compiler knows the type of every variable. 
                            In Go there are no implicit type conversions, for example, uint8 and uint16 are different types (except in some cases).</p>
                    <p class="text">Easy to work with: It's concise, explicit and easy to read.</p>

                Go was designed at Google in 2007, in response to criticisms with the languages that 
                were in use by Google engineers at the time. The language design revolved around efficiency, 
                Readability/Usability, and high-performance networking and multiprocessing. Robert Griesemer, 
                Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson started gathering ideas for the language in September of 2007. 
                By 2008, Ken started working on a compiler for the language which at the time generated C 
                code as output. By mid 2007, the language had become a full-time project and had developed 
                to the point where construction of a production compiler was in their sights. In May 2008 Ian
                Taylor started on a GCC front end for Go using the team’s ideas and draft specifications. 
                Russ Cox joined the team in 2008 and helped translate the language draft and its libraries 
                into a functional language. At the time of Go’s creation, the two main languages to write 
                servers were C++ and java. Go was designed to reduce the repetition of these languages, the 
                idea was to have efficiency, fluidity, and safety in a single language. The list below contains 
                examples of famous open source projects that were programmed in Go:

        <p class = text> 
            To install the Go compiler, go to the following link: <a href = "https://golang.org/doc/install">Golang Installation</a>. This will walk you through 
            the installation for a compiler for Go. You can install cgo to translate Go into C. Choose the compiler that matches your operating system. For information
            on building and running programs, please check out the programs page. It contains information on how to build and run as well as sample go programs.
