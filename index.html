                Go was designed at Google in 2007, in response to criticisms with the languages that 
                were in use by Google engineers at the time. The language design revolved around efficiency, 
                Readability/Usability, and high-performance networking and multiprocessing. Robert Griesemer, 
                Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson started gathering ideas for the language in September of 2007. 
                By 2008, Ken started working on a compiler for the language which at the time generated C 
                code as output. By mid 2007, the language had become a full-time project and had developed 
                to the point where construction of a production compiler was in their sights. In May 2008 Ian
                Taylor started on a GCC front end for Go using the team’s ideas and draft specifications. 
                Russ Cox joined the team in 2008 and helped translate the language draft and its libraries 
                into a functional language. At the time of Go’s creation, the two main languages to write 
                servers were C++ and java. Go was designed to reduce the repetition of these languages, the 
                idea was to have efficiency, fluidity, and safety in a single language. The list below contains 
                examples of famous open source projects that were programmed in Go:
